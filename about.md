Welcome to the "Locate the Public Toilet" app, that was developed for the Developing Data Products Course, from Coursera. This app helps you to locate public toilet facilities using data from data.gov.uk. Currently the dataset only contains data from five cities which are Bournemouth, Manchester, Northumberland, Peterborough and Sheffield

First, you need to select the city or town. These information will be used to list out all public toilets located in that city. Then you can select facilites available at the toilet at the specific area including the category of the toilet, baby diapers changing, family toilet, changing room and lastly whether there is a charge for using the toilet using input slider.

The table will show only the cars with the filters selected. You can sort the table according to the variable you want by clicking the arrows at the top of the table.

With this app, it would help local authorities to provide more public toilet facilities at location where less number of public toilet and facilities available. 

Source code for ui.R and server.R files are available on the [GitHub](https://github.com/thissomimie/dataproducts).
